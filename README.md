# ACT is a multi-agent system programming framework 

ACT stands for Agent Cognitive Technology. Simultaneously, acting is one of the most important steps after all cognitive processes have been performed. This is where the accronym and the resulting name comes from.

## Why?
There are a lot of frameworks that work on the principle of agents. However, many of them are no longer in active development and others do not have a suitable open source license to create commercial products. In addition, the philosophy of the projects ranges from "programming everything yourself" instead of relying on open standards and common libraries to implementing outdated principles. In order to protect itself from standard bugs, this project concentrates exclusively on the agent concepts and relies on popular libraries and standards. 

## Goals of ACT
ACT is intended to fill this gap. 
 - It should be based on suitable libraries that allow a commercial exploitation on the basis of OpenSource. 
 - It should use well-known libraries in such a way that the difference between agents and microservices becomes clear. 
 - It should replace outdated principles with pragmatic approaches and open standards. 

## What ACT does not do.
ACT is not intended to: 
 - to become the next MVC framework
 - to be just a framework in the jungle
 - define your own standards

# Status
This project is still in the definition phase or as an incubator project.
